## Frequently Asked Questions

### I want a page/post to have a blank body, i.e. no text

Simply add a space or other invisible character. One is enough.

### I'd like to include my own custom variables

Default Text checks for the existance of a function named `default_text_gemini` before outputting title or body text.

Either inclue this function in your themes `functions.php` file or in a custom plugin.

Make sure that the function outputs an associative array in the following format:
`array('$variable'=>'value');`
